The following Python libraries are used in the algorithm:

os: This library provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing the script to handle file paths and operations.
re: The regular expression library is used for pattern matching in the log file to filter out valid rows.
numpy (np): Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It is used to efficiently store and manipulate arrays, which helps optimize memory usage.
heapq: The heapq module provides heap queue algorithms, which are used to find the top 50 songs based on their play counts efficiently.
json: The json library is used for serialization and deserialization of data. It is used to save and load intermediate results to/from files.
datetime: The datetime module provides functions to work with dates and times. It is used to get the current date in the required format for file naming.
time: This module is used to measure the execution time of the algorithm.
psutil: The psutil library allows the script to monitor system resource usage. It is used to get memory usage information during the execution of the algorithm.
